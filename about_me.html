            <p>Hello, my name's Halie Eckert! I'm a senior at Kent State University with a deep passion for programming.
                I have experience with Python, Java, basic web development, and database systems. I'm currently employed as a 
                student employee, as well as a co-op student at Sherwin-Williams. After I graduate, I plan on furthering my
                career at Sherwin-Williams.</p>

            <h2>Experience And Projects</h2>
            
            <h3>Sherwin-Williams Intern/Co-Op</h3>
            <p>At Sherwin-Williams, I've had the oppurtunity to be involved in multiple projects, such as the ProDash Upgrade.
                On this project, I played a part in updating Sherwin-Williams web dashboard for their Pro-users, such as painters and
                contractors. I also manage, document, and maintain, CPRA banners on all PSG Sherwin domains.</p>
            
            <h3>Spatial-Social Networks Research</h3>
            <p>Location-based social networks have grown in size and popularity in the past two decades due to their 
                real-world versatility. In such networks, it is important to create a spatial-social network that 
                not only looks into personal relationships among users but also their geographical closeness on road 
                networks. This research focuses on creating a system to analyze and query such networks.</p>

            <h3>KSU Ticketing System Data Transfer</h3>
            <p>This project aimed at creating a data export of open service tickets, reformat the export, and import 
                the data to a new ticketing system. A python script was created to work with the ticketing system 
                API and build the import file.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy fish and reptile keeping and (unsurprisingly) programming. I currently have 
                13 aquariums, a gecko, and two cats in my small apartment. I also foster cats with the Portage 
                APL and have asisted with rehabilitating and finding over 20 cats their forever homes.</p>
